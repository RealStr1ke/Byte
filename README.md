**This is a multipurpose Discord bot that @RealStr1ke is currently working on.**

**Notice: Everything before the commit named "Beginning of Interaction Rewrite" is a legacy version of the bot that mostly based on slash commands. As of Aug 8, 2022, all slash commands so far are registered as application commands while I build a framework specifically for guild application commands.**
